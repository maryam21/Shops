        Acceptance criteria: liked shops shouldnâ€™t be displayed on the main page

To start using the app first configure the .env file in the root directory of the project:

    CLIENT_HOST=<your frontend server address>
    SERVER_HOST=<your backend server address>
    SERVER_PORT=<the port in which the backend server is listening>
    SERVER_API=<backend server api> // e.g 'localhost:3000/api'
    API_KEY=<API key from google developers console>
    DATABASE=<your database url> // e.g 'mongodb://localhost/my_database'
    SESSION_SECRET=<a phrase to be used for the session>

Start the backend server with:
   
    cd backend/
    npm start
    
And the frontend server in development mode:

    cd frontend/
    npm run dev
  
Or production mode:

    npm run build
