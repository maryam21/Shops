# Shops
App that lists shops nearby

To build this app I used Nodejs in the backend and Vuejs for the frontend.

To start using the app first configure the .env file in the root directory of the project:

    CLIENT_HOST=<your frontend server address>
    SERVER_HOST=<your backend server address>
    SERVER_PORT=<the port in which the backend server is listening>
    API_KEY=<API key from google developers console>
